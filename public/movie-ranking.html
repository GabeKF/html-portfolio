<h1>Gabe's Movie List</h1>
<h2>Some of my Favorites..</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Joker (2019)</h3>
    <p>Loved the dark, cruel, real world atmosphere. Felt like I was actually in Gotham City.
    Great performance from Joaquin.</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight (2008)</h3>
    <p>The best intro scene to a movie I have ever seen.</p>
<h3>Dune 2 (2024)</h3>
    <p>Chamalet's second half performance blew me away. Saw it the day it came out and then saw it again
       the next day.</p>
